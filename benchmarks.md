## Performance Tips

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Cache preprocessed text features
   - Use efficient text cleaning methods
   - Consider using spaCy's small model for basic NLP tasks

2. **Model Selection**
   - Balance model size vs. accuracy
   - Consider ensemble methods for better accuracy
   - Use quantized models when possible

3. **Optimization**
   - Batch predictions if possible
   - Use numpy vectorization
   - Avoid unnecessary loops
   - Cache frequent computations

4. **Memory Management**
   - Release unused resources
   - Use generators for large datasets
   - Monitor memory usage during development
